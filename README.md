# PP Savani University

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I maintain my semester-wise projects and practical assignments. Below, you'll find a directory structure guiding you through the contents.

## Semesters

- [Semester 1](./Semester1/README.md)
- [Semester 2](./Semester2/README.md)

## How to Navigate

- Each semester directory contains individual project folders and practical assignments.
- Explore the `README.md` files in each directory for project-specific or subject-wise information.

Feel free to explore and learn from my projects and practical assignments. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
